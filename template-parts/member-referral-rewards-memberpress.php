                    <p>
                        There is no more romantic place on the planet than Sonoma County, California. Escape the
                        doldrums and the ho-hum everyday life, and get lost in a world of romance, rolling
                        hills,
                        and rosé. With this trip, you'll be transported back to the 1920s -- to the Golden Age
                        of
                        golf -- when you step foot on the grounds of historic Sonoma Golf Club, a
                        playable-yet-challenging relic of that great era of the game, when life was simple and
                        culture was roaring. Get a taste of that culture, too, with privileged access to a
                        private

                        never
                        disappoints. Across all this endless golf, no two shots are ever the same at Black
                        Diamond.
                        Come see what it means to play a different kind of golf in a different kind of Florida.
